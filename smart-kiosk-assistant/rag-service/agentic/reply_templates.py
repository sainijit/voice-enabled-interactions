"""Customer-facing sentences for deterministic order-mutation tool outcomes.

Background
----------
Every mutating tool call today costs **two** LLM round-trips: one to decide
the tool and its arguments, and a second, purely to narrate a result the
server already knows in full — order_id, item names, total, upsell display
strings. On Panther Lake's single iGPU that second call is ~half the LLM time
in a typical turn (see tests/benchmarks/results/replay-qwen3-4b-postfix.json).

Google ADK supports skipping that second call natively: a tool sets
``tool_context.actions.skip_summarization = True`` and returns a plain string,
and ``Event.is_final_response()`` treats that as the end of the turn — no
second model call happens. See ``agentic/ordering_agent.py::_make_mcp_callable``
for where this module is used.

**Why these templates are written fresh here rather than reusing
``kiosk_core.ordering.mcp_server``'s ``unavailable_message`` /
``choice_message`` strings**: those strings are authored *for the model*, not
the customer. They read like "Do not invent them and do not ask the customer
to try again. Tell them those are unavailable and offer these real
alternatives instead: ..." — instructive prose meant to steer the LLM's next
completion. Speaking that verbatim over TTS would be nonsense. Every sentence
below is built only from *structured* fields (names, prices, totals, ids) that
the server already validated, never from those instruction strings.

Design
------
Every function here returns ``None`` when the tool outcome does not cleanly
match one of the templates below (e.g. a partial success mixed with a
rejection). Returning ``None`` means "fall through to the normal LLM
narration call" — the safe default. A function is never called on a result it
cannot describe with total confidence; when in doubt, the LLM still speaks.

Pure functions, no I/O, no LLM round-trip — unit-testable exactly like the
guards in this package.

    the tool result. Every name and price here is copied verbatim from

    model's paraphrase, never less: it cannot drop, rename, or re-price a row.

# Restaurant name and operating hours are answered by having the LLM

# not reliable even at temperature=0.0: two identical requests to the same
# quantised model produced "8 AM to 11 PM Monday through Saturday" and later
# "8 AM to 12 AM on weekdays", both merging the source's genuinely distinct
# Mon-Thu/Fri-Sat/Sun ranges into one, and the second additionally invented
# an unsupported "closed on public holidays" claim. For a restaurant's own
# hours, a wrong answer is a worse defect than an unstyled one, so these two
# facts are spoken directly from the parsed structured value — no LLM call,
# no paraphrase, no possibility of merging or inventing.
#
# Deliberately narrow: only the two facts empirically shown to be unreliable.
# Every other root-level fact (parking, wifi, delivery, ...) keeps using the
# existing pre-grounded LLM narration path, since simple string facts like
# "shared parking lot" carry little risk of being merged or hallucinated.
