"""Agent configuration — all settings are env-driven.

Environment variables:
    AGENT_LLM_URL      Base URL of the OVMS OpenAI-compatible endpoint
                       (default: http://ovms-llm:8000/v3)
    AGENT_LLM_MODEL    Model name served by OVMS (default: Qwen3-4B)
    AGENT_MCP_CONFIG   Path to mcp_servers.json
                       (default: ./agentic/resources/mcp_servers.json)
    AGENT_LOG_LEVEL    Logging level for the agentic package (default: INFO)
    AGENT_SESSION_TTL  In-memory session TTL seconds (default: 3600)
    AGENT_ENABLE_THINKING
                       Render the Qwen3 chat template in thinking mode
                       (default: false — thinking tokens are pure decode cost)
    AGENT_TEMPERATURE  Sampling temperature for the agent LLM (default: 0.0)
    AGENT_TOP_P        Nucleus sampling cutoff (default: 1.0)
    AGENT_SEED         Sampling seed forwarded to OVMS (default: 42)
    AGENT_MAX_TOKENS   Max generated tokens per LLM round-trip (default: 320)
    AGENT_RETRY_ON_MISSING_TOOL_CALL
                       Retry a turn once when the model promises a lookup but
                       calls no tool (default: true)
    AGENT_NUM_ASSISTANT_TOKENS
                       Speculative-decoding draft length forwarded to OVMS —
                       how many tokens the draft model proposes per cycle
                       before the target model verifies them in one batched
                       pass (default: 5, OVMS's documented sweet spot). Only
                       has an effect when ovms-llm is started with
                       --draft_source_model. Set to 0 to disable per-request
                       without touching the OVMS deployment.

# from ~5.0 s to ~2.8 s.
#
# This is OFF by default and deliberately so. chat() applies several
# whole-reply guards that can *replace* or *regenerate* an answer after the
# fact (unbacked order claims, forced knowledge/catalogue recovery, leaked
# tool syntax). A sentence that has already been spoken cannot be recalled,
# so early emission is only safe for sentences that provably cannot trigger
# any of those paths — see _SentenceGate. Set to false to fall back to the
# buffered path with no rebuild.
