# Audio Analyzer — Diarization Improvement Plan

**Date:** 2026-07-01  
**Author:** Copilot  
**Status:** Proposed — Not Yet Implemented  

---

## 1. Problem Statement

When two people speak within the same audio chunk (5–15 s), the current pipeline only
surfaces one speaker's text to the kiosk. The other voice is silently discarded.
Additionally, cross-chunk speaker labels are unstable: pyannote resets its anonymous
IDs (`SPEAKER_00`, `SPEAKER_01`, …) on every chunk, so the same physical person can
receive different labels in consecutive chunks. This causes the kiosk-core speaker
filter to lock onto a stale label and either drop the customer's own speech or keep
a staff member's voice.

### Root Causes (two layers)

#### Layer 1 — Inside `audio-analyzer` (pyannote)

`PyannoteDiarizer.diarize()` calls `output.exclusive_speaker_diarization`, which is
pyannote's **exclusive / non-overlapping** mode. When two people speak simultaneously
the dominant voice wins and the overlap is discarded entirely. Each Whisper ASR segment
is then assigned a speaker by **midpoint lookup**:

```python
mid = (sent["start"] + sent["end"]) / 2.0
for turn in speaker_turns:
    if turn["start"] <= mid <= turn["end"]:
        speaker = turn["speaker"]
        break
```

If the segment midpoint falls in a gap or on the boundary of two turns the speaker is
`UNKNOWN`. If the segment spans two speaker turns the midpoint arbitrarily picks one.

No `min_speakers` / `max_speakers` constraint is passed to pyannote, so the clustering
algorithm is free to produce 3–5 phantom speakers on short noisy audio.

#### Layer 2 — Inside `kiosk-core` (speaker filter)

`_filter_target_speaker()` in `audio_session.py` locks onto the **first meaningful
KNOWN speaker label** as `primary_speaker_id` and discards every other speaker for the
entire session. Because pyannote resets its anonymous labels per chunk, the same
physical customer can appear as `SPEAKER_01` in chunk 2 after being `SPEAKER_00` in
chunk 1 — causing their own speech to be discarded as a "secondary voice".

There is no embedding-based cross-chunk identity matching. The only fallback is a
keyword-overlap semantic scorer, which fires only when the primary is completely silent
for a full chunk.

## 2. Scope

| Service | Files Affected |
|---|---|
| `audio-analyzer` | `components/asr/diarization/pyannote_diarizer.py` |
| `audio-analyzer` | `components/asr_component.py` |
| `audio-analyzer` | `config.yaml` |
| `kiosk-core` | `kiosk_core/audio_session.py` |

---

## 3. Proposed Solution — Two Phases

### Phase 1 — Fix inside `audio-analyzer`

#### 1a. Switch from `exclusive` to full `Annotation` output

`exclusive_speaker_diarization` collapses overlapping speech. Switching to the full
`Annotation` object preserves overlapping turns and gives the caller a complete picture.

```python
# current
diarization = output.exclusive_speaker_diarization

# proposed
diarization = output   # full pyannote Annotation — includes overlapping regions
```

#### 1b. Expose all speaker turns that overlap each time window

Instead of returning a single `{start, end, speaker}` per turn, return every turn that
overlaps with the chunk so that `asr_component.py` can make a more informed assignment
decision.

Response shape is unchanged — we still emit `{start, end, speaker}` items — but now
overlapping regions produce two entries with different `speaker` labels, which callers
can inspect.

#### 1c. Pass `min_speakers` / `max_speakers` config hints to the pipeline

For a kiosk (1 customer + at most 1 staff member), constraining the speaker count
dramatically reduces pyannote clustering errors on short audio:

```python
# pyannote_diarizer.py
output = self.pipeline(
    audio_input,
    min_speakers=self.min_speakers,   # from config, default 1
    max_speakers=self.max_speakers,   # from config, default 2
)
```

```yaml
# config.yaml — new fields under models.diarization
diarization:
  provider: "huggingface"
  name: "pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1"
  device: CPU
  models_base_path: "models"
  min_speakers: 1      # NEW — minimum expected speakers per chunk
  max_speakers: 2      # NEW — maximum expected speakers per chunk
```

**Risk:** near-zero. If audio is silent or single-speaker, pyannote correctly returns
one label even with `min_speakers=1`.

#### 1d. Assign speaker by maximum overlap area, not midpoint

The midpoint heuristic breaks when a Whisper segment spans two speaker turns. Replace
it with the turn that has the **greatest time overlap** with the segment interval:

```python
# current (midpoint)
mid = (sent["start"] + sent["end"]) / 2.0
for turn in speaker_turns:
    if turn["start"] <= mid <= turn["end"]:
        speaker = turn["speaker"]
        break

# proposed (max overlap)
best_speaker, best_overlap = None, 0.0
for turn in speaker_turns:
    overlap = min(sent["end"], turn["end"]) - max(sent["start"], turn["start"])
    if overlap > best_overlap:
        best_overlap = overlap
        best_speaker = turn["speaker"]
speaker = best_speaker
```

**Risk:** near-zero. Strictly more correct than midpoint.

#### 1e. (Optional) Expose per-speaker embeddings in the response

Pyannote internally computes speaker embeddings during clustering. Expose the mean
embedding for each speaker label as an optional field in the diarization response so
kiosk-core can do cross-chunk identity matching without loading a second model.

Proposed addition to the segment dict:

```json
{
  "speaker": "SPEAKER_00",
  "start": 0.5,
  "end": 3.2,
  "embedding": [0.12, -0.04, ...]
}
```

---

### Phase 2 — Fix inside `kiosk-core`

#### 2a. Replace label-based lock with embedding-based cross-chunk identity

Add a `primary_speaker_embedding` field to `BaseAudioSession` alongside the existing
`primary_speaker_id`:

```python
# current
self.primary_speaker_id: str | None = None   # anonymous label only

# proposed
self.primary_speaker_id: str | None = None
self.primary_speaker_embedding: np.ndarray | None = None   # 192-dim cosine vector
```

Lock-on logic becomes:

1. First chunk with a meaningful segment → compute/store embedding as primary.
2. Every subsequent chunk → cosine-compare new segment embedding against stored primary.
3. Similarity ≥ threshold (e.g. 0.75) → confirmed same person → keep / promote.
4. Similarity < threshold → different voice → discard (or trigger semantic fallback).

This makes the primary speaker **identity-stable** across chunk boundaries even though
pyannote resets its anonymous labels every chunk.

#### 2b. Consume `embedding` field from audio-analyzer response

If Phase 1e is implemented, kiosk-core reads the `embedding` from the segment dict
directly — no second embedding model needed in kiosk-core. If not implemented, a
lightweight fallback (e.g. SpeechBrain ECAPA-TDNN already available in the model
stack) can be used.

#### 2c. Config-driven similarity threshold

Add `DEFAULT_SPEAKER_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` to `kiosk_core/config.py` (env var:
`KIOSK_CORE_SPEAKER_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD`, default `0.75`) so the threshold can be
tuned per deployment without code changes.

## 5. Recommended Implementation Order

```
Step 1 (Quick wins — no new models, minimal risk)
  → 1c: min_speakers/max_speakers in config + pyannote call
  → 1d: max-overlap speaker assignment in asr_component.py

Step 2 (Correct the architecture)
  → 1a + 1b: full Annotation output + overlapping turns in response
  → 2a + 2b: embedding-based cross-chunk identity in kiosk-core
  → 2c: similarity threshold config

Step 3 (Optional / advanced)
  → 1e: expose raw pyannote embeddings in the segment response
```

## 6. Validation

| Check | How to Verify |
|---|---|
| Two speakers in same chunk both appear in logs | `docker logs audio-analyzer \| grep DIARIZATION` — two distinct `SPEAKER_XX` entries per chunk |
| Same customer keeps primary across chunks | `docker logs kiosk-core \| grep SPEAKER-FILTER` — `primary_speaker_id` unchanged across chunk boundaries |
| Staff voice correctly discarded | Speak as staff while customer is silent → `DISCARD (secondary voice)` in logs |
| `min_speakers` reduces phantom speakers | Single-person audio produces exactly 1 speaker label, not 3–5 |
| Max-overlap correct on boundary segments | Segment spanning two turns → speaker = turn with longer overlap |
