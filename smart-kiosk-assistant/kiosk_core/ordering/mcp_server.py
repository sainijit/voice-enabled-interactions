"""MCP server for kiosk-core ordering tools.

Exposes ordering operations as MCP tools via HTTP using ``fastmcp``.
The agent connects to this server at ``/mcp`` on the kiosk-core port.

The server is mounted into the FastAPI app — not run as a separate process.

Tools exposed:
  - list_products   — list available menu items (optional category filter)
  - place_order     — create a new draft order
  - update_order    — add/increment items on an existing draft order
  - get_order       — get order summary (items, quantities, total)
  - confirm_order   — confirm a draft order → returns Order ID
  - get_upsell_suggestions — get upsell recommendations for a cart
"""

    Each incoming item may carry the product reference under ``product_id``,
    ``name``, or ``product`` — and that reference may be a real id, a spoken
    name, or a value the LLM fabricated. Every reference is resolved against
    the catalogue via OrderingService.resolve_product so a wrong-format id no
    longer fails the order.

    Resolution is deliberately **per item**. An earlier version aborted the
    whole call on the first unresolvable reference, which silently discarded
    the items the customer really did ask for: a single fabricated id in a
    multi-item request ("4 burgers, 3 fries, 1 cold coffee, 4 petty_fries")
    dropped all four lines and left the cart empty, and the agent then had
    nothing to confirm. Valid items must always reach the cart; only the
    fabricated reference is refused.

    Args:
        dietary: ``"vegetarian"``/``"vegan"`` when the agent knows this
            customer stated that preference this session. Only narrows the
            "did you mean" suggestions offered for an *unresolved* reference
            (e.g. plain "burger" matching several products) — it never blocks
            an explicit, uniquely-resolved order for a specific item, so a
            customer who is more specific than their earlier statement is
            never second-guessed.

    Returns:
        ``(resolved, rejected, ambiguous, resolved_display)``. ``resolved``
        holds {product_id, quantity} entries using real catalogue ids, exactly
        what ``OrderItemIn`` expects. ``rejected`` holds {reference,
        suggestions} for every reference not on the menu. ``ambiguous`` holds
        {reference, category, choices} for references that name a whole
        category rather than a product. ``resolved_display`` parallels
        ``resolved`` with the resolved product's real name attached, for
        templating a customer-facing sentence without a second catalogue
        lookup — kept as a separate list rather than an extra key on
