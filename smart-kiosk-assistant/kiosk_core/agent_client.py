"""AgentClient — HTTP client for the rag-service agent endpoint.

Sends kiosk turns to the rag-service agent and yields the reply as text
chunks, so callers can feed TTS incrementally.

Two transports are supported, selected by ``config.AGENT_STREAM_ENABLED``:

* **Buffered** (default) — ``POST /api/v1/agent/chat``. The agent orchestrates
  its tools and post-processing guards over the whole reply, so the response
  arrives as one chunk and is yielded as one chunk.
* **Streaming** — ``POST /api/v1/agent/chat/stream``. The agent releases
  complete sentences as they are generated, but only once it can prove the
  turn is not one its whole-reply guards might rewrite. Sentences are yielded
  as they arrive and any unspoken remainder is yielded at the end, letting TTS
  overlap with generation.

Both paths run the reply through :func:`validate_reply` before the turn ends;
in the streaming path a correction that fires after audio was already spoken
causes the corrected reply to be replayed in full.
