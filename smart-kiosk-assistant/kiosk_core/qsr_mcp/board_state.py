"""Kiosk on-screen menu-board mode — a small, durable actuator state.

The Central QSR Agent's act tool ``set_board_mode`` (see ``mcp_service.py``)
flips the kiosk's menu board between ``"full"`` and ``"simplified"`` (e.g. in
response to a deep queue — qsr-design §7 action #6: "Kiosk queue deep/short
-> Kiosk board simplify"). This module is the single place that owns that
state so both the MCP act tool and (future) kiosk-ui/menu endpoints agree on
the current mode.

Kept intentionally simple relative to the ordering DB: this is one row of
state, not a relational schema, so a small JSON file (guarded by a lock) is
used instead of pulling in aiosqlite for a single toggle. Durable so a
restart does not silently forget an agent-set mode mid-shift.
