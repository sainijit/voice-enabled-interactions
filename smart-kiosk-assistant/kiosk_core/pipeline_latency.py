"""
Turn-level AI pipeline latency tracker.

Captures one TurnTrace per completed voice turn and holds the last N in a
thread-safe ring buffer.  Exposed via GET /api/v1/pipeline/latest and
GET /api/v1/pipeline/recent on kiosk-core.

Design principles
─────────────────
* Wall-clock E2E is MEASURED (ended_at − started_at), never summed from stages,
  so the TTS-overlap with LLM generation is handled correctly.
* Spans are NESTED: retrieval and llm live under agent (matching runtime reality).
* An ``invoked`` flag on retrieval prevents stale latency leaking across turns.
* All durations use monotonic clock (time.monotonic); ISO timestamps use datetime.
