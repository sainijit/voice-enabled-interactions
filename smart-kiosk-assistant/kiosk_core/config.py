#
# When enabled, kiosk-core opens one persistent WebSocket per audio session
# and streams PCM frames to the analyzer continuously as they're captured,
# instead of POSTing a WAV file per flush. ASR then runs throughout speech
# (not just after a pause begins), so a fresh transcript is usually already
# available the instant the endpoint/silence decision fires -- this is what
# activates the otherwise-inert DEFAULT_ENDPOINT_SHORT_SECONDS shortcut above.
#
# This is a single global flag (not a per-session/per-request option) so the
# same kiosk-ui and benchmark REST APIs exercise whichever mode is selected
# server-side, with zero client-side changes either way. The file-based POST
# path (AnalyzerClient) remains untouched as the fallback: if the socket
# fails to connect for a given session, that session transparently falls
# back to the file-based path rather than failing the turn.

# adaptive flush. Two distinct defects followed from that:
#
#   1. ASR quality — the cut landed mid-word, so Whisper saw fragments.
#      Observed verbatim in production logs: "something" was split into

#   2. Speaker identity — the severed tail is a 0.5-1.5s fragment. Speaker
#      embeddings computed over such a short span are unreliable, so the
#      analyzer clustered the tail as a *different* speaker and the
#      diarization filter discarded the customer's own words.
#
# 6.0s lets a normal single utterance complete inside one chunk. The adaptive
# pause flush (0.70s) still cuts at natural boundaries, so latency for ordinary
# speech is unchanged — this cap now only bites on genuinely continuous speech,

# Raised from 0.30 → 0.70s: at 0.30s, natural in-phrase pauses (e.g. between

#
# Lowered 0.70 -> 0.50s (2026-09-10, ITEP endpoint-latency work): re-tested the

# and rec2_16k.wav (real recorded speech, 3 runs each):
#   * 0.50s: transcripts identical/correct vs the 0.70s baseline on both

#   * 0.40s: reproduced the same class of hallucination the 0.30s value
#     caused originally — "Good." became "Good, good, good." (repeated word)
#     and a phantom "Bye, bye." was inserted; rec2's trailing "french fry" was

# ── Preview flush (continuous mid-speech ASR, not just at the pause) ───────
# Without this, a long utterance is only ever flushed to ASR once — at the
# adaptive pause above, AFTER the customer stops talking — so the entire
# utterance's audio is on the critical path for that one ASR round-trip. That
# round-trip has been measured landing at ~1.23-1.28s, later than even
# DEFAULT_ENDPOINT_SHORT_SECONDS (1.0s), which is why the completeness
# shortcut below rarely gets a chance to fire (see
# docs/performance-improvements-2026-09.md, "preview-ASR work").
#
# This flushes accumulated speech to the background ASR worker periodically
# WHILE the customer is still talking (not just at chunk_seconds or the
# pause), so by the time silence begins, most of the utterance has already
# been transcribed off the critical path — the chunk flushed at the adaptive
# pause is then much shorter (only the audio since the last preview tick),
# lands sooner, and gives the completeness shortcut a real chance to fire.
#
# Every preview flush reuses the exact same _flush_chunk path as the
# existing chunk-size-cap and adaptive-pause flushes — same
# transcript_parts append, same DEFAULT_DIARIZATION_INTERMEDIATE_ENABLED
# gating, same >=0.5s minimum-content guard. It is not a separate throwaway
# code path; it only changes WHEN a chunk boundary is cut.
#
# Gated by self._flush_queue.unfinished_tasks == 0 at the call site (i.e. no
# other flush is currently in flight) because audio-analyzer serialises all
# WhisperPipeline.generate() calls behind a single global lock — a shorter
# fixed tick interval would just queue up requests behind an already-running
# call rather than run concurrently.
#

# ── Speculative drafting (Round 3: agent/TTS cache-warming ahead of endpoint) ─
#
# The ASR-side fixes above (persistent httpx client, preview-ASR flush)
# close the gap on transcription only. The dominant remaining cost by far is
# the agent/LLM call + TTS synthesis, which today only ever starts AFTER the
# customer stops talking and the endpoint fires — this is the structural
# reason the reference "lab" prototype reaches ~700ms voice-to-voice while
# this pipeline sits several seconds higher: the lab fires a fresh
# agent+TTS draft on every ASR tick DURING speech (newest-wins), so a
# matching draft/audio usually already exists by the time its endpoint
# fires; here, nothing downstream of ASR has reacted to a preview transcript
# until now.
#
# This flag enables that: on every preview-ASR flush (see
# DEFAULT_PREVIEW_FLUSH_ENABLED above), a background thread fires a
# SPECULATIVE agent turn (chat(..., speculative=True)) against the
# transcript-so-far. The server FORCES every mutating ordering tool
# (place_order/update_order/confirm_.../cancel_order/remove_from_order) into
# dry_run mode for the whole turn — see _MUTATING_TOOLS/_speculative_ctx in
# plugins/kiosk/ordering_agent.py — so a speculative call built on a
# still-changing, possibly-incomplete transcript can NEVER write a real row
# to the orders database, no matter what the agent decides to call. This
# was verified directly against a live SQLite file (dry_run=True leaves order/
# order_item row counts unchanged) before this flag was wired in.
#
# "Newest-wins": only the LATEST-STARTED draft's result is ever kept (see
# BaseAudioSession._speculative_generation) — an older call that happens to
# return after a newer one started is discarded outright, since a longer or
# corrected transcript snapshot makes it stale.
#
# Kept deliberately SAFE-SCOPED for this rollout: the real (endpoint-fired)
# turn always still runs its own full, fully-guarded LLM call exactly as
# before — nothing here skips or replaces it. The benefit is (a) the LLM's
# own prefix-cache/tool-call code path is already warm by the time the real
# call runs, and (b) DEFAULT_SPECULATIVE_TTS_PRESYNTH_ENABLED below can
# pre-synthesise the draft's predicted reply so a byte-identical real
# sentence is served instantly instead of re-synthesised. A true "skip the
# LLM/guards entirely and replay the draft's tool calls for real" optimisation
# (closing the rest of the gap to the lab's ~700ms) is intentionally NOT
# implemented here — it would require replaying draft results through the
# same guard/reply-construction pipeline the LLM path uses, not just
# re-dispatching raw tool calls, and was judged too large/risky to rush
# alongside everything else in this round. Recommended as a dedicated,
# carefully-tested follow-up.
# DEFAULTED TO FALSE (2026-09-08 live-replay finding): both the LLM (OVMS)
# and TTS backends in this deployment serialise requests — they do not run
# a speculative call and the real turn's call concurrently, they queue them.
# Live replay of tests/rec2_16k.wav showed the real turn's own tts= time
# balloon to ~21.8s, matching almost exactly the ~21s consumed synthesising
# 5 speculative sentences immediately beforehand — i.e. the real turn was
# stuck waiting behind its own speculative work, not helped by it. Overall
# wall time for that turn (38.2s) was far WORSE than the pre-speculative
# baseline (~5.8s). Until the backends are confirmed/configured to serve
# concurrent requests (e.g. multiple OVMS/TTS worker instances or a request
# queue with priority for the real turn), enabling this trades a latency
# win for a latency loss. Code path is fully safety-verified (see dry_run
# notes above) and left in place as an opt-in for when backend concurrency

# sentence ("I would like one classic chicken burger").
#
# A loudness detector cannot tell those two apart, so it needs one fixed wait.
# Reading the transcript can: if the words so far end on a filler ("um"), a
# dangling function word ("and", "with", "I'd") or a comma, the customer is
# mid-thought and we keep the full timeout. Otherwise we commit early.
#
# This only ever SHORTENS the wait, and only when a transcript already exists.
# If ASR has not returned yet, the text is empty or stale, the check fails
# closed and behaviour is identical to the fixed timeout.
#
# INVARIANT (WAIVED, see below): the guard normally requires this to be
# strictly greater than DEFAULT_ADAPTIVE_FLUSH_PAUSE_SECONDS (0.50) and

# flush has fired and its ASR result has had time to land before the

# on THIS pipeline the value is inert at 0.15s, because the adaptive flush
# that produces the transcript the completeness check reads does not fire
# until 0.50s of silence (DEFAULT_ADAPTIVE_FLUSH_PAUSE_SECONDS) — the
# `_adaptive_flushed` guard in audio_session.py is still False at 0.15s, so
# every turn falls through to the DEFAULT_SILENCE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS wait
# regardless of this setting. The lab reaches 0.15s because its NPU runs
# continuous ASR (a rolling transcript snapshot every ~0.4s WHILE the
# customer is still talking — see kiosk-voice-handoff.pdf, change #1), so a
# fresh transcript is always available well before 150ms of silence. Set to
# 0.15 here as a forward-looking value; it becomes load-bearing once

#
# Rather than hand-tuning the constant per venue (impossible when the venue
