            #    without speaking — speaking any prompt looks like the button
            #    had no effect.
            #  - Rejected-speech (speaker filter / diarization): often triggered
            #    by Whisper hallucinations ("you", "thank you", etc.) on
            #    background noise or TTS echo from the previous turn. These are
            #    not real utterances, so "I couldn't recognise your voice" is
            #    a false alarm on the FIRST occurrence.
            #  - "silence_timeout": VAD ended the turn with no speech — the
            #    customer is either not there or not ready; prompting can feel
            #    intrusive and the UI already shows "🎧 Listening…" or re-arms
            #    automatically in conversation mode.

            # STREAK (config.DEFAULT_CONSECUTIVE_REJECTION_THRESHOLD

            # silent forever there regressed to the exact problem the retry
            # prompt originally existed for — a genuinely ignored customer
            # (real bystander, or a mistuned enrollment rejecting them) gets

        Mirrors kiosk-voice-lab-main's ``assess_complete(text, stable)``,
        which requires two consecutive tick snapshots to agree before trusting
        a "finished-sounding" transcript — see
        config.DEFAULT_ENDPOINT_STABLE_SECONDS for why: a word-list check like
        _looks_complete can read "complete" on a transcript that a moment
        later turns out to have been truncated mid-utterance.

        Clocked on ``silence_run_seconds`` (audio-domain: frames-of-silence
        seen so far), NOT wall-clock time.monotonic(). Audio frequently
        arrives in network bursts (chunked HTTP pushes from the benchmark or
        the browser UI alike) — the frame loop can drain a whole burst of
        already-buffered silent frames in a few milliseconds of real time,
        advancing silence_run_seconds by hundreds of ms almost instantly.
        A wall-clock stability window could then never accumulate its 0.2s
        before the audio-domain silence_timeout_seconds cutoff arrived first,
        so the shortcut would silently never fire. silence_run_seconds
        already IS the correct clock the rest of this endpoint logic uses.

        State (the last-seen text and when it started reading that way)
        persists on the instance across calls, since this is evaluated once
        per frame (every DEFAULT_BLOCK_DURATION_SECONDS) while the endpoint's
        other gates are open. The stored/compared value is the normalized
        word-key from _endpoint_stability_key(), not the raw transcript, so a
        punctuation-only ASR hallucination on the trailing silence tail
        (e.g. "...please." -> "...please. .") cannot restart the window --
        only an actual change in the recognized words can.

        Only ever WITHHOLDS an early commit relative to the old behaviour —
        if the transcript is still changing, the caller falls through to the
        existing full silence_timeout_seconds wait, exactly as it would if
        _looks_complete itself had failed.

        DEFAULT_ENDPOINT_STABLE_SECONDS == 0 is a distinct, intentionally
        looser mode: trust the FIRST snapshot that reads complete, instead of
        requiring it to read the same way again on a second call. The
        two-confirmation design normally needs two ASR round trips (each
        measured 90-220ms) to land inside the ~0.15-0.40s shortcut window —
        on real hardware that is frequently too tight (measured: shortcut
        firing rate swings 0%-80% run to run purely on round-trip luck, see
        docs/performance-improvements-2026-09.md), so most turns fall back to
        the full silence_timeout_seconds wait even though the first
        transcript was already correct. Single-confirmation trades away the
        guard against a transcript that "reads complete" for one tick and
        then turns out to have been truncated mid-utterance a tick later —
        re-validate against the fixture/scripted benchmarks if this is
        lowered further or re-enabled after being disabled.
