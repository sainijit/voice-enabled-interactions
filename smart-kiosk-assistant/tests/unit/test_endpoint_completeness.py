"""Unit tests for the adaptive endpoint's sentence-completeness check.

These are tier1 (no Docker/ML/audio hardware required) — ``_looks_complete``
is pure string work over the transcript assembled so far.

Background: ``KIOSK_CORE_SILENCE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` has to cover the worst case
(a customer hesitating mid-sentence), so it was raised to 1.5s after 0.65s cut
people off mid-order. That makes *every* turn pay the hesitation tax, including
the majority that end on an obviously finished sentence.

A loudness detector cannot tell those two apart; reading the words can. This
check only ever SHORTENS the wait, so every uncertain case must return False
and fall back to the full timeout. The tests below pin that fail-closed
behaviour in both directions.
