"""Voice-to-voice latency benchmark using real recorded fixtures.

Why this exists
----------------
``agent_latency_benchmark.py`` (tier B) and ``conversation_replay_benchmark.py``
both replay TTS-*synthesised* prompts at ``realtime_factor=100`` (as fast as
kiosk-core allows). That is the right tool for isolating LLM/TTS compute cost,
but it is the WRONG tool for voice-to-voice: replaying at 100x skips the
customer's actual trailing silence, so the endpoint detector never runs
through its real wait, and neither script even reads ``voice_to_voice_ms`` or
``endpoint_wait_ms`` out of the trace.

This script instead:

* Replays real recorded human-speech WAV fixtures — not synthesised audio.
  No fixtures ship in this repo (to keep it free of binary recordings);
  supply your own via one or more ``--fixture`` flags.
* Drives kiosk-core through the same **continuous streaming** session API the
  browser UI itself uses — ``POST /api/v1/sessions/start-stream`` followed by
  repeated ``POST /api/v1/sessions/{id}/audio`` chunk pushes and a final
  ``POST /api/v1/sessions/{id}/audio/end`` — instead of ``start-file``
  (single whole-file upload, paced open-loop on the server). Each fixture is
  sliced into ``--push-chunk-seconds`` WAV chunks and pushed one at a time,
  sleeping between pushes at ``realtime_factor`` speed, exactly like
  ``gradio_app.py``'s ``on_chunk``/``_push``. This exercises the exact same
  ``BrowserStreamSession`` code path (and therefore the exact same VAD/
  endpoint-detection/``_t_last_word`` logic) that live customer traffic runs
  through — ``start-file``'s ``FileAudioSession`` shares that VAD logic too,
  but never round-trips audio over HTTP incrementally the way a live browser
  does, so it under-exercises chunk-arrival timing/jitter.
* Replays at ``realtime_factor=1.0`` (real-time — the default), so the
  customer's actual trailing silence is what trips the endpoint detector,
  exactly as it would live.
* Reads ALL of kiosk-core's wall-clock fields from the turn trace, not just
  ``time_to_first_audio_ms``: ``voice_to_voice_ms``,
  ``voice_to_voice_informative_ms`` and ``endpoint_wait_ms`` alongside
  ``turn_total_ms``/``time_to_first_audio_ms``.
* Reports mean/median/p90/**p95** (p95 is the customer-facing target — a
  single bad tail turn is what a customer actually notices; median hides it).
* Writes per-turn latencies and the aggregate summary to a JSON file under
  ``smart-kiosk-assistant/results/``.

Usage::

# as-is so existing tooling keeps working.
#
# The defining identity is:
#
#     voice-to-voice = endpointing delay + processing latency
#
# which holds EXACTLY per turn in our pipeline (verified: endpoint_wait_ms +
# voice_to_voice_post_endpoint_ms == voice_to_voice_ms on every turn).
#
# Two traps this encodes deliberately:
#
#   * "processing latency" is measured turn-end-decision -> first sound, i.e.
#     voice_to_voice_post_endpoint_ms. It is NOT time_to_first_audio_ms.
#     Those differ because work is started speculatively DURING the silence
#     wait, so ttfa overlaps the endpointing window -- on shortcut turns ttfa
#     is ~195ms while processing latency is ~3ms, because the audio was
#     already rendered by the time the turn-end decision fired.
#
#   * "transcription latency" is reported PER CALL (asr_ms is the sum over
#     all chunks in the turn), because that is the per-call convention the
#     <200ms target is expressed against.
