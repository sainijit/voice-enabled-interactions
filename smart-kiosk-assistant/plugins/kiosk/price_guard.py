"""Guard against a spoken total that disagrees with the tool's own number.

Background
----------
``place_order``/``update_order``/``confirm_active_order``/``get_current_order``
results all carry an authoritative ``total`` computed by kiosk-core from the
real catalogue and cart contents. The common, successful path never risks a
wrong number: ``reply_templates.speak()`` builds the reply directly from that
same payload, so the spoken total and the billed total are always the same
value.

The risk is the *fallback* path — a turn where no template applies (an
unrecognised tool, or the model free-generating text about an order already
described earlier this conversation) lets the model restate a total from its
own context window rather than from this turn's tool result. Language models
transpose and round digits under exactly these conditions; a customer told a
different total than what is actually charged is a real billing complaint
waiting to happen, matching ``kiosk-voice-lab-main``'s ``total_guard()``
(``pipeline/cart.py``).

Design
------
Mirrors ``menu_guard``/``confirm_guard``/``removal_guard``: per-turn state in
a ``contextvars.ContextVar``, a ``record_tool_result()`` call at the same
call site as those guards, and a ``validate_reply()`` used by the whole-reply
post-hoc guard chain in ``ordering_agent.chat()``.

Unlike those guards, a wrong total is *corrected* rather than blocked or
replaced wholesale: the actual total is already known with certainty, so
there is no need to fall back to a generic refusal — swapping in the right
number is strictly better for the customer than a full reply substitution
that has to re-describe the whole order from scratch.
