"""Guard against adding a stale/pending item instead of the one just named.

Background
----------
Observed live: the customer had an item pending confirmation ("Would you like
to proceed with ordering French fries?"), then said "Go ahead and add a
pizza." The model's ``update_order``/``place_order`` tool call still carried
``"french fries"`` as the item reference — it resolved successfully (French
fries genuinely are on the menu), so ``menu_guard`` sees a clean success and
has nothing to correct. The customer is told a pizza was added while French
fries land in the cart, and the wrong item is written to the database.

This is not an off-menu problem (``menu_guard``'s territory) or a false
confirm-without-a-tool-call problem (``order_claim_guard``/
``_ORDER_CLAIM_FALLBACK``). It is the tool call itself carrying a stale
argument the model failed to update against what the customer just said.

Design
------
Rather than detect the bad write after it lands and speak a correction (which
still leaves a wrong row in the cart until something rolls it back), this
guard corrects the **tool-call argument before the call is made** — the same
philosophy as the dietary-preference injection in ``ordering_agent.py``:
deterministic ground truth from the current turn's raw utterance overrides
whatever the model decided to pass.

Scope is deliberately narrow to avoid false corrections:

* Only single-item ``place_order``/``update_order`` calls are considered.
  A multi-item call ("fries and a pizza") is left untouched — safely
  disambiguating which of several references is stale is out of scope, and
  leaving the call alone preserves today's (correct, most of the time)
  behaviour rather than risking making it worse.
* The utterance must contain an explicit, extractable "add/order X" phrase.
  A bare confirmation ("yes", "go ahead", "sounds good") has no such phrase,
  so the guard does nothing and the pending item is correctly used as-is.
* The correction only fires when the named phrase shares **no** meaningful
  token overlap with the tool call's reference — a paraphrase of the same
  item ("the classic burger" vs. "classic chicken burger") still overlaps and
  is left alone; only a clearly *different* item swaps the reference.

The module performs no I/O and makes no LLM round-trip, so it can be unit
tested as pure functions over text.
* The named phrase must not be *anaphoric*. This is the constraint whose
  absence made the first version of this guard actively harmful. "Yes, one of
  those" and "I'd like to try all of them" both match the add/order pattern,
  but they point at products established earlier in the conversation, which
  the model had already resolved correctly. Substituting the literal words
  produced replies like "Sorry, we don't have of those on the menu" and threw
  away a valid four-item order. When the customer is vague, the model's
  context-resolved reference wins.
